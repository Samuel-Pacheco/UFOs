# UFOs
- Using Javascript in VS Code, bootstrap to write out an HTML to make a UFO sightings page.

# Overview.
We built an HTML page that will allow us to pull up information from a javascript data scripted from VS Code using filters on the page. We want to use filters since we have many different sightings that occurred.

# HTML Page and our results

Entering the website our client will see the basic opening and title with the picture at the top, as the client scrolls down they will begin to see all the data and filters, We have 5 different filters to choose from; the date, city, state, country & shape. You can choose any of these filters enter the search bar, then the HTML page will show all of the sightings for that specific search.

# Summary
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
One drawback about our search bar is trying to validate the sitings that happened which can be better described in the data.
two recommendations for improving this website.
- Have more data thats including a population counter to the sight.
- Adding another filter or even a posible scraper function that would keep the page updated with further sightings.
